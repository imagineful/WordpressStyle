# purpose
revise the wordpress 2017 style css to make the layout more beautiful or reasonable

# the problem of current style.css 
the post body is too narrow, as for Chinese words, only 32 words per line, which will lead a bad reading experience for readers.

# solution
change the ratio of the primary sidebar (post content) and the secondary sidebar (search, category, etc) to make it more readable.

# Usage
the style-origin.css is the backup file for style.css in Wordpress 2017 official theme.
the style-current.css is the current version after revision.

just copy the content of style-current.css, and replace the style.css in your wordpress (Appearance->Editor-> find style.css in bottom left)
